I am mechanizing 50 acoustic guitars, one for each of the United States.","<p>Music plays a profound role in our cultural identity. I am creating a gallery installation about our collective musical experience as Americans. I am mechanizing 50 acoustic guitars, one for each of the United States. The guitars will be of all different ages, types, and origins, creating a diversity of tone as unique as we are. Each instrument will be tuned to a different chord inspired by our musical grandparents: Blues and Country. The guitar automatons will be strummed in unison, creating an immersive sound collage. Now, I need YOU to help make this idea come to life!</p>

<p>The America I adore is deeply polarized to the point of violent interaction. &nbsp;I want to make a piece that taps into our national ethos: Country and Blues, the two most American musical art forms. We all have a favorite song. When we love a song, it has the power to stimulate the full spectrum of feelings and memories. This power is also capable of building empathy and transcending political discord. I want to create a piece that dissects, affirms and perhaps makes us question our own personal myths of what it means to be an American.</p>

<h1>Hey Kickstarter, We&rsquo;re Back</h1>

<p>This is not our first rodeo. Back in 2015, we took Kickstarter by storm with the first SmartHalo, with over 3,000 pledges from the community. Since then, we&rsquo;ve delivered&nbsp;<strong>25,000 units</strong>&nbsp;to cyclists in over 70 countries. We struck a deal with&nbsp;<strong>Apple</strong>, distributing in their stores all over North America and Europe. We&rsquo;re quite proud and it&#39;s all thanks to you.&nbsp;</p>
